For example, you could sort results by the value of the \"name\" field of a nested \"person\" object.\\n\\nTo use the nested filter argument, you need to specify the path to the nested field, followed by the operator and value. For example, the following query would sort results by the value of the \"name\" field of the nested \"person\" object:\\n\\n```\\nsort: {\\n  person.name: asc\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can also use the nested filter argument with the \"filter\" argument to further refine the results of your query. For example, the following query would sort results by the value of the \"name\" field of the nested \"person\" object, and only include results where the \"age\" field is greater than 18:\\n\\n```\\nsort: {\\n  person.name: asc\\n}\\nfilter: {\\n  age: gt: 18\\n}\\n```',\n",
