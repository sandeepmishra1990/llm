R3 Milestone 10 deliverables - 0.13.0


New Features


Data Definition - Refer here for full changes "OSDU schemas" and full changes "OSDU reference-values"

Schema Highlights

Indexing Hint Changes: Critical schema fragments were changed such that queries into frequently used arrays of objects return more
scoped responses. This causes a massive re-indexing of existing records since virtually all storable osdu kinds
include the following fragments - see more details in Migration Guides.
LogCurveType and LogCurveFamily augmented with explicit relationships.

TechnicalAssurance added to all types via AbstractCommonProperties

New Schemas for Well Planning DDMS and Drilling Execution - Well Planning Introduction via Examples, Well Execution Introduction via Examples

Seismic Model Enhancements

Seismic surveys/projects/interpretation sets behave like activities.
Pre-Stack support, mostly additional properties, though deprecations for SeismicAcquisitionSurvey



New Schemas for Earth Modeling/Reservoir - Introduction via examples

New Schemas related to GeoReferencedImage



Reference Value Highlights

Content Revision for UnitOfMeasure, UnitQuantity, Property (based on PWLS 3) - now also with aliases details


LogCurveType with relationships details


LogCurveFamily with relationships details

Well Planning and Drilling Execution adds 47 new reference value types, details

Earth Modeling/Reservoir adds 26 new reference value types, details

Seismic acquisition/pre-stack related reference value types, details

New reference value type for geo-reference image GeoReferencedImageType, TechnicalAssurance

Breaking Changes

Deprecation Notice

Wellbore DDMS:

V2 APIs

The support of JSON orient “columns” format is removed on all V3 write bulk APIs. Client must use JSON orient “split”. No change on read bulk APIs

Known Issues/Gaps

There is a known gap in validation due to shortage of time and resources
