New Features
Data Definition - Refer here for full changes "OSDU schemas" and full changes "OSDU reference-values"
Schema Highlights
Indexing Hint Changes for work-product-component--DataQuality and reference-data--QualityDataRuleSet: all records referring to these kinds must be re-indexed to make the changes take effect. This also changed the query syntax. It is not expected that a large number of such records are in production use. see also Migration Guides.
LogCurveType and LogCurveFamily augmented with explicit relationships.
New schemas for Earth Modelling/Reservoir: Aquifer - Introduction via examples
Integration of Seismic, Well and Earth Modelling/Reservoir via stratigraphy
Introduction via Stratigraphy examples, including new WellboreIntervalSet, explaining the interrelations between 'tops', intervals and interpretations (eventually relating to feature instances). See Migration Guides
The new SeismicFault:1.0.0 and SeismicHorizon:1.1.0 become 'representations' and can be included in UnsealedSurfaceFramework. FaultSystem:1.1.0 links to FaultInterpretations. See also Migration Guides
Well Execution: FluidsReport:1.1.0 extension and corrections to VirtualProperties DefaultName definitions.
Well Delivery: WellLog:1.2.0 got extended with curve sample types (reference values) and log remarks. See also Migration Guides
New unit symbol mapping support via ExternalUnitOfMeasure and related, see worked example for use cases.
Enhancement to Organisation:1.1.0 supporting hierarchical structures, example.
Documentation changes, including
Changes of some reference value types' descriptions to align with the PPDM sources.
Moved WorkedExamples folders to names without the schema version numbers as most examples are version independent or updated to the latest schema version where necessary.
Minor enhancements to the Schema Usage Guide
Example CRS record ids adjusted to the new OSDU default CRS Catalog conventions.
Reference Value Highlights
New, Geomatics approved default CRS Catalog content in the form of a large reference value manifest file. The governance is still LOCAL and large operators will replace the content entirely. A new record id-convention has been established to enable data exchange across environments and matching reference values with identical behaviour.
Content for UnitOfMeasureConfiguration with content provided by ExxonMobil and Shell. This LOCAL data set is only considered an example.
Example content for ExternalUnitOfMeasure, ExternalUnitQuantity and ExternalCatalogNamespace corresponding to the new schemas published above.
PPDM alignment: a number of reference value catalogs are curated by PPDM. PPDM is then the source and provides PPDM style workbooks, which are parsed and turned into reference value manifests. OSDU adopts the description of the reference value catalog from PPDM.
Minor Online Schema Usage Guide improvements.
